        <p>About this game
Grand Theft Auto V is a continuation of the game franchise dedicated to robberies. The action of the game takes us to Los Santos, where we will observe the stories of three characters: Michael, Trevor and Franklin. As usual, the plots are headed by robberies, robberies and shootouts, but at the same time the game has an excellent plot that reveals all the main characters. The player must choose the end of the story himself, for this the developers have prepared three endings.

Today <span id="GTA">GTA</span> V has two official editions:

Enhanced – a modern version with redesigned graphics (4K, HDR, improved textures and lighting), updated network code and support for all the latest patches.
Legacy – a classic edition with an original visual style and lenient system requirements, ideal for laptops and older PCs, as well as for players who value maximum compatibility with release-time mods.</p>
